 # Task-2

 ## Student Record Management System

In the 3 Java files Student.java file helps in creating objects, CRUD.java file helps in performing operations and we perform the operations from Main.java file

All records are stored in the form of objects in the ArrayList and Those Objects are Student objects which are divided into 3 fields 'Id', 'Name' and 'Marks'

I have created the CLI-based CRUD system for Record Management, I have created 4 methods in the CRUD java file representing the CRUD System those are 
### 1. add() to Create records ----> C
--> add() method you can create single or multiple records at same time and you cannot enter the same Id again as we cannot accept the duplicates but 'Name' and 'Marks' can be repeated but not 'Id' as it need to be kept unique.
### 2. view() to read records  ----> R
--> view() method you read the records that existing after you have added it does not have any default records.
### 3. update() to update records -> U
--> update() method is used to update a particular field in a particular record based on Student 'Id'.
### 4. delete() to remove records -> D
--> delete() method is used to delete a particular records or all records.
